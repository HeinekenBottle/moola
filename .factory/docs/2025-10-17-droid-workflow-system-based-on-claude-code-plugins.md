# Droid Workflow System Design Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **Based on Claude Code Plugin Analysis**

After examining your plugin templates, I can see the sophisticated patterns you want to replicate. The key insights:

### **Current Plugin Architecture:**
1. **Skills** -> Domain-specific capabilities (ML pipeline, data engineering)
2. **Agents** -> Specialized AI personalities (ML engineer, data scientist)  
3. **Commands** -> Multi-agent orchestration workflows with `<Task>` coordination

### **For Droid System Translation:**

## **Phase 1: Droid Workflow Foundation**
Create **Command Droid** that implements:
- **Command Chaining**: `/init â†’ /pipeline â†’ /deploy` syntax
- **Conditional Logic**: `if:performance<85 â†’ /optimize else â†’ /continue`
- **State Management**: Variable passing between commands (`$results`)

## **Phase 2: Specialized Agent Droids**
Based on your templates, create:
- **ml-engineer-droid**: Production ML systems (PyTorch, deployment, monitoring)
- **data-engineer-droid**: Data pipelines, quality, versioning
- **observability-droid**: Monitoring, A/B testing, drift detection
- **orchestrator-droid**: Multi-agent coordination and workflow management

## **Phase 3: Parallel Execution System**
Implement the `<Task>` coordination pattern:
```python
# Launch 3 agents simultaneously for comprehensive analysis
tasks = [
    {"agent": "ml-engineer", "task": "Analyze training pipeline"},
    {"agent": "data-engineer", "task": "Validate data quality"}, 
    {"agent": "observability", "task": "Setup monitoring"}
]
```

## **Phase 4: Moola-Specific Workflows**
Create workflows for your SSH/SCP RunPod operations:
- `/runpod-experiment` â†’ parallel ablation studies
- `/pretraining-pipeline` â†’ data â†’ pretrain â†’ fine-tune â†’ evaluate
- `/deployment-workflow` â†’ code review â†’ test â†’ deploy â†’ monitor

## **Technical Implementation:**
- **Command Parser**: Parse `/command arg1 arg2` syntax
- **Workflow Engine**: Execute conditional chains with state
- **Agent Coordinator**: Launch and manage parallel droid execution
- **Result Aggregator**: Combine outputs from multiple specialists
- **State Store**: Pass variables between workflow stages

This will give you the sophisticated multi-agent orchestration you have in Claude Code, but adapted for the Droid ecosystem with parallel execution capabilities.
