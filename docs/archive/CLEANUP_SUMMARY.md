# 80/20 Cleanup Summary - October 17, 2025

## What I Did (15 minutes, focused)

### 1. ✅ Fixed Git Hooks (Was Broken)
- **Problem:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` didn't exist, hooks weren't running
- **Solution:** Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with Black, Ruff, isort
- **Result:** Next time you commit, hooks auto-run and enforce code quality
- **Action:** On your Mac, run `pre-commit install` once

### 2. ✅ Created Results Logging System
- **Problem:** MLflow infrastructure yesterday was overkill and unusable
- **Solution:** Simple `ResultsLogger` class in `src/moola/utils/results_logger.py`
- **Result:** Experiments log to JSON file, append-only, no database
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  logger = ResultsLogger()
  logger.log(phase=1, experiment_id="exp_1", metrics={"accuracy": 0.87})
  # That's it. Results in experiment_results.jsonl
  ```

### 3. ✅ Documented SSH/SCP Workflow
- **File:** `WORKFLOW_SSH_SCP_GUIDE.md`
- **Contains:** Step-by-step guide for your exact workflow
- **No more:** Shell scripts, Docker, complexity, surprises

### 4. ✅ Cleaned Up Agents
- **Problem:** Agents didn't understand your constraints (SSH/SCP only, no Docker)
- **Solution:** Created `.claude/SYSTEM.md` to tell future agents what NOT to do
- **Result:** Agents won't recommend Docker/MLflow/infrastructure anymore

### 5. ✅ Removed Confusing Skills
- **Problem:** Yesterday I created 6 skills (add-type-hints, mlflow-tracker, etc.) that assumed infrastructure you don't have
- **Solution:** Deleted all those skills
- **Result:** Clean `.claude/skills/` directory (now empty, ready for focused skills)

---

## What Stayed (Working, Don't Touch)

- ✅ SimpleLSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-Transformer models
- ✅ Pre-training orchestration
- ✅ Data infrastructure (schemas, validators, drift detection)
- ✅ Your existing experiments and results

---

## What You Need To Do (One-time Setup)

### On Your Mac

```bash
cd ~/projects/moola

# 1. Install pre-commit (one time)
pip install pre-commit==4.3.0

# 2. Install hooks (one time)
pre-commit install

# That's it. Next commit, hooks run automatically.
```

### On RunPod

Nothing special. Just use SSH to connect and run experiments:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/runpod_key ubuntu@YOUR_IP
cd /workspace/moola
python -m moola.cli train --model simple_lstm --device cuda
```

---

## New Workflow (Start Using Immediately)

### 1. Code Change on Mac
```bash
nano src/moola/models/simple_lstm.py
git add .
git commit -m "Fix SimpleLSTM"
# ✓ Hooks run automatically (Black, Ruff, isort)
```

### 2. Training on RunPod (via SSH)
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/runpod_key ubuntu@YOUR_IP
cd /workspace/moola
python -m moola.cli train ...
```

### 3. Get Results (via SCP)
```bash
# From Mac (different terminal):
scp -i ~/.ssh/runpod_key ubuntu@YOUR_IP:/workspace/moola/experiment_results.jsonl ./
```

### 4. Compare Results (on Mac)
```python
import json
results = [json.loads(line) for line in open('experiment_results.jsonl')]
best = max(results, key=lambda x: x['metrics'].get('accuracy', 0))
print(f"Best: {best['experiment_id']}")
```

---

## What's Gone (Deleted From Yesterday)

❌ Confusing skills that assumed infrastructure you don't have
❌ MLflow recommendations
❌ Docker setup guidance
❌ Complex multi-hour configuration systems

---

## Files Changed

```
.pre-commit-config.yaml      (NEW - Hook configuration)
WORKFLOW_SSH_SCP_GUIDE.md    (NEW - How to work)
src/moola/utils/results_logger.py  (NEW - Simple results logging)
```

---

## Key Files to Know

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Git hooks (Black, Ruff, isort) |
| `WORKFLOW_SSH_SCP_GUIDE.md` | SSH/SCP workflow guide |
| `src/moola/utils/results_logger.py` | Results logging (no database) |
| `.claude/SYSTEM.md` | System instructions for agents (don't edit) |

---

## Bottom Line

- **No shell scripts** ✓ (Removed)
- **No Docker** ✓ (Won't recommend)
- **No MLflow infrastructure** ✓ (Replaced with simple logging)
- **No multi-hour setup** ✓ (One-time pre-commit install)
- **Simple SSH/SCP workflow** ✓ (Documented completely)

**Next time you need help:** I won't recommend Docker or MLflow. I'll suggest SSH, SCP, and simple Python.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Setup pre-commit on Mac:**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit==4.3.0
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Read the workflow guide:**
   ```bash
   cat WORKFLOW_SSH_SCP_GUIDE.md
   ```

3. **Start using it:**
   - SSH to RunPod
   - Run experiments
   - SCP results back
   - Evaluate locally

That's it. You're done with cleanup.

**Time spent:** 15 minutes
**Setup time (your end):** 5 minutes
**Value:** Clean workflow, no infrastructure headaches, rapid iteration
