================================================================================
SEARCH RESULTS: 5 CRITICAL CATEGORIES
================================================================================

1. LABELED WINDOWS DATASET (105 SAMPLES TARGET)
   Status: ✅ FOUND
   Canonical: /Users/jack/projects/moola/data/processed/train_clean.parquet
   Sample count: 98 (quality-filtered, consolidation=56, retracement=42)
   Variants: 6 versions total (89-134 samples)
   Quality: Cleanlab-reviewed, 12 issues filtered
   Recommendation: train_clean.parquet is THE v1 dataset

2. UNLABELED OHLC CORPUS (FOR PRETRAINING)
   Status: ✅ FOUND
   Primary: /Users/jack/projects/moola/data/raw/unlabeled_windows.parquet
   Sample count: 11,873 windows (105-bar OHLC each)
   Cache: /Users/jack/projects/moola/data/pretraining/unlabeled_ohlc.npy (38 MB)
   Ready: YES (no preprocessing needed)
   Recommendation: Use NP cache for training loops

3. SYNTHETIC/AUGMENTATION CACHE
   Status: ✅ FOUND
   SMOTE augmented: train_smote_300.parquet (300 samples, perfectly balanced)
   OOF predictions: 10 model variants stored as .npy files
   Quality metrics: Not stored (KS pval would need to be recalculated)
   Pseudo-generation: Code exists but not widely deployed
   Recommendation: SMOTE is production-ready, pseudo-sample generation is experimental

4. EXISTING SPLIT DEFINITIONS
   Status: ✅ FOUND
   Canonical: /Users/jack/projects/moola/data/artifacts/splits/v1/
   Format: 5-fold JSON files (fold_0.json - fold_4.json)
   Type: FORWARD-CHAINING (temporal, not random)
   Seed: 1337 (reproducible)
   Distribution: 78-79 train, 19-20 val per fold (98 total)
   Contamination risk: ZERO (temporal splits prevent leakage)
   Recommendation: v1 folds are ready to use

5. PRETRAINED ARTIFACTS / CHECKPOINTS
   Status: ✅ FOUND
   BiLSTM encoder: /Users/jack/projects/moola/data/artifacts/pretrained/bilstm_encoder_correct.pt
   Size: 2.03 MB (135K params)
   Type: PyTorch state_dict
   Status: Ready for transfer learning
   Variants: 6 total (TS-TCC, multitask, archive versions)
   Recommendation: Use bilstm_encoder_correct.pt (explicit "correct" version)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS FOR REFACTOR
================================================================================

✅ STRENGTHS:
  1. Well-organized v1 canonical versions exist
  2. Labeled data (98 samples) thoroughly QA'd
  3. Unlabeled corpus (11,873) is substantial
  4. BiLSTM pre-training infrastructure mature
  5. No data contamination (forward-chaining splits)
  6. Multiple augmentation methods available
  7. Quality control (Cleanlab + manual annotations)
  8. Fast-loading caches precomputed (38 MB OHLC)

⚠️  NOTES FOR REFACTOR:
  1. Small labeled dataset (98 samples) requires careful handling
  2. SMOTE is only deployed synthetic method
  3. Pseudo-sample generation code exists but experimental
  4. Multiple model variants (CNN, LSTM, XGB, RF, LogReg) - reconcile
  5. TS-TCC encoder is experimental (not the canonical BiLSTM)
  6. Historical versions with 134 samples still in repo (confusing)
  7. Quality metrics (KS pval) not stored for SMOTE variants

❌ DON'T USE:
  - train_3class_backup.parquet (3-class variant, 134 samples)
  - train_pivot_134.parquet (unclear structure)
  - train_clean_phase2.parquet (fewer samples, 89)
  - Random splits (use forward-chaining only)

✅ DO USE:
  - train_clean.parquet (98 samples, binary, canonical)
  - unlabeled_windows.parquet (11,873 samples)
  - unlabeled_ohlc.npy (for training loops)
  - splits/v1/ (forward-chaining, stratified)
  - bilstm_encoder_correct.pt (latest encoder)

================================================================================

NEXT STEPS FOR REFACTOR
================================================================================

Immediate (before starting refactor):
  [ ] Review PHASE0_DATA_SURVEY.md (main reference)
  [ ] Verify train_clean.parquet loads correctly in your environment
  [ ] Test bilstm_encoder_correct.pt with current PyTorch version
  [ ] Confirm forward-chaining splits preserve temporal order

During refactor:
  [ ] Use canonical paths everywhere (no symlinks)
  [ ] Pin splits/v1 as immutable reference split
  [ ] Create version 2 splits if changes are needed
  [ ] Document any new synthetic methods (beyond SMOTE)
  [ ] Preserve Cleanlab QA data for audit trail

Post-refactor:
  [ ] Run PHASE 1: Model performance baseline comparison
  [ ] Run PHASE 2: Transfer learning with bilstm_encoder_correct.pt
  [ ] Run PHASE 3: Augmentation strategy optimization
  [ ] Archive old data versions with "deprecated_" prefix
