## Key Statistics Across All Docs

- **Problem**: Countdown loss stays at 15.9 despite 20 epochs training
- **Root cause**: Gradient scale 0.18x due to reduction bias (per-timestep 105 outputs vs dense 2 outputs)
- **Effective learning rate ratio**: countdown gets 2.6% of pointer task learning rate
- **Mathematical error factor**: sqrt(2/105) = 0.138 (theory) vs 0.178 measured (empirical validation)
- **Recommended fix**: Uncertainty weighting (5 min implementation)
- **Implementation time**: 5-30 minutes depending on fix choice

## Quick Copy-Paste Verification Commands

### Test if problem exists:
```bash
python3 scripts/train_expansion_local.py
# Look for countdown_loss barely changing across epochs
```

### Check gradient scales:
```python
# Add to training loop after backward()
ptr_grad = model.pointer_head[1].weight.grad.norm().item()
cd_grad = model.expansion_countdown_head[1].weight.grad.norm().item()
print(f"Gradient ratio (cd/ptr): {cd_grad/ptr_grad:.3f}")  # Should be ~0.18 (problem)
```

### After implementing a fix:
```python
# Should see gradient ratio ~1.0 after fix
print(f"Gradient ratio (cd/ptr): {cd_grad/ptr_grad:.3f}")  # Should be ~1.0 (fixed)
```
