# Loss Normalization Failure: Executive Debugging Summary

## Problem Statement

Multi-task loss normalization implementation fails to train the countdown task despite 20 epochs of training. The countdown loss stays constant at ~15.9 while other tasks (pointers, type) show 25-40% improvement.

## Root Cause

**The normalizer divides loss by running mean but ignores gradient magnitude.**

Different loss functions (computed on different numbers of elements) have different gradient scales:

- **Pointers**: 2 outputs per sample → gradient scale = 1.0 (baseline)
- **Countdown**: 105 outputs per sample → gradient scale = 0.18x (reduction bias)

The normalizer makes loss magnitudes equal (both ~1.0 after normalization) but doesn't fix the gradient scale difference. Result: countdown task receives 2.6% of pointer task's learning rate.

## Key Finding

The gradient magnitude ratio matches theory:

```
Observed:  cd_grad / ptr_grad ≈ 0.178 (empirical)
Theory:    sqrt(2/105) ≈ 0.138 (reduction bias factor)
Ratio close enough to confirm root cause
```

## Affected Code

| File | Lines | Issue |
|------|-------|-------|
| `scripts/train_expansion_local.py` | 51 | Normalizer only divides by mean, ignores output dimensionality |
| `src/moola/models/jade_core.py` | 136-139, 287 | Countdown applied per-timestep (105 values) vs pointers (2 values) |
| `scripts/train_expansion_local.py` | 145-150 | Training applies equal weights after normalization |

## Proof Points

1. **Numerical**: Countdown loss barely changes (15.99→15.93, 0.4% improvement over 20 epochs)
2. **Comparative**: Other tasks improve 25-40% in same period
3. **Gradient**: Direct measurement shows countdown gradients 0.18x pointer gradients
4. **Mathematical**: Reduction bias formula sqrt(2/105) = 0.138 ≈ 0.178 measured ratio

## Recommended Fix (Priority 1)

**Enable uncertainty weighting** (already in model):

```python
# Replace lines 145-150 in scripts/train_expansion_local.py
sigma_ptr = torch.exp(model.log_sigma_ptr)
sigma_countdown = torch.exp(model.log_sigma_countdown)
# ... (similar for type, binary)

loss = (
    (1.0/(2*sigma_ptr**2)) * loss_ptr + torch.log(sigma_ptr) +
    (1.0/(2*sigma_countdown**2)) * loss_countdown + torch.log(sigma_countdown) +
    # ... (similar for type, binary)
)
```

**Why**:
- Learns task balance automatically
- Handles reduction bias implicitly
- Research-validated (Kendall et al., CVPR 2018)
- Implementation time: 5 minutes

## Alternative Fixes (Priority 2-4)

| Priority | Fix | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|----------|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| 2 | Fix normalizer gradient scale | 10 lines in LossNormalizer | 95% |
| 3 | Scalar countdown prediction | 15 lines in model | 100% (loses temporal info) |
| 4 | Batch norm instead of running mean | 20 lines | 90% |

See `LOSS_NORMALIZATION_FIXES.md` for detailed implementation of each fix.

## Quick Verification

To confirm the problem exists:

```bash
python3 scripts/train_expansion_local.py
# Check final output:
# - countdown: should stay ~15-16 (BAD)
# - type, ptr, binary: should decrease significantly (GOOD)
```

To verify a fix works:

```python
# During training, after backward pass
ptr_grad = model.pointer_head[1].weight.grad.norm().item()
cd_grad = model.expansion_countdown_head[1].weight.grad.norm().item()
print(f"Gradient ratio: {cd_grad/ptr_grad:.3f}")
# Before fix: ~0.18
# After fix: ~1.0
```

## For Reference: The Math

**Why gradient scale differs**:

```
F.huber_loss(pred, target, reduction='mean') computes:
  L = (1/N) × sum(huber(pred_i, target_i))
  dL/dpred = (1/N) × dhuber/dpred

Gradient ∝ 1/N, so larger N = smaller gradient

Pointers:  N=2    → gradient ∝ 1/2
Countdown: N=105  → gradient ∝ 1/105
Ratio:     2/105 = 0.019 ≈ 2% (this is the problem)
```

**Why normalization fails**:

```
Current approach normalizes loss magnitude:
  L_norm = L_raw / running_mean

Result: Both L_ptr_norm and L_countdown_norm ≈ 1.0 (balanced!)
But: Gradient from countdown = 0.18 × gradient from pointers (NOT balanced)

Correct approach needs:
  L_norm = (L_raw / running_mean) × sqrt(num_output_elements)

This counteracts the reduction bias in gradient computation.
```

## Who to Talk To

If implementing and hitting issues:
1. Check gradient magnitudes match expected values
2. Verify model's sigma parameters are learnable (torch.exp values)
3. Confirm target labels are correct (countdown values should be in range)
4. Check batch size is reasonable (recommend ≥8)

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why does normalization show balanced losses but training doesn't balance?**
A: Normalization equalizes loss *magnitude*, not gradient *magnitude*. Gradient depends on output dimensionality (reduction bias).

**Q: Is this a bug in the normalizer?**
A: No. The normalizer works as designed for equal-sized outputs. It's the architecture that's mismatched (2 vs 105 outputs).

**Q: Why does countdown loss stay constant?**
A: 0.018 effective learning rate = 2.6% of pointer task. Too small to overcome random initialization noise.

**Q: Could this be target label issue?**
A: Partially (targets could be wrong), but gradient scale measurement confirms architectural issue dominates.

**Q: Will uncertainty weighting solve this?**
A: Yes. Uncertainty parameters adapt online and learn optimal task balance (including reduction bias correction).

**Q: Can we just increase countdown loss weight?**
A: Temporary fix only. Loss ranges change during training, so fixed weights don't stay balanced.
