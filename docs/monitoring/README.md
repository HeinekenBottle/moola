## Component Overview

### 1. A/B Testing Framework (`ab_testing_framework.py`)

**Purpose**: Rigorous statistical comparison of model variants with business impact analysis

**Key Features:**
- Sequential A/B testing with interim analysis
- Multiple comparison correction (Bonferroni, Benferroni-Hall, FDR)
- Early stopping for underperforming models
- Power analysis for sample size determination
- Business metrics integration (accuracy, latency, cost throughput)

**Implementation:**
```python
from monitoring.ab_testing_framework import create_simple_lstm_ab_test

# Test configuration
framework = create_simple_lstm_ab_test(
    control_model_path="models/simple_lstm_v1",
    treatment_model_paths=["models/simple_lstm_v2", "models/cnn_transformer"],
    alpha=0.05,
    min_effect_size=0.03
)

framework.start_test()
```

**Alerts Generated:**
- `ABTestDurationExceeded`: Running longer than 14 hours
- `ABTestUnevenTraffic`: Traffic distribution imbalance >10%
- `ABTestConfidenceNotAchieved`: Insufficient samples for statistical significance

### 2. Performance Tracking (`performance_tracker.py`)

**Purpose**: Real-time performance monitoring with degradation detection and automated rollback triggers

**Key Features:**
- Performance budget enforcement
- Multi-level alerting (warning, critical, emergency)
- Statistical degradation detection
- Trend analysis and forecasting  
- Reliability score calculation (0-1 composite)

**SimpleLSTM Budget Targets:**
- Accuracy: ≥80%
- Latency: ≤50ms (p95)
- Memory: ≤50MB
- Cost: ≤$0.001/prediction
- Uptime: ≥99%

**Degradation Detection:**
- Statistical analysis using rolling windows
- Baseline establishment with automatic updating
- Multi-metric correlation analysis
- Early stopping for significantly degraded models

### 3. Business Metrics Bridge (`business_metrics_bridge.py`)

**Purpose**: Transform technical performance into business KPIs for stakeholder visibility

**Business Value Calculation:**
```python
# Revenue Impact
daily_revenue = accuracy × daily_volume × $0.05 - 
               (false_negatives × $0.10) - 
               (false_positives × $0.02)

# Cost Efficiency
efficiency_score = revenue_impact / total_infrastructure_cost
```

**Business KPIs Monitored:**
- **Revenue Impact**: Daily contribution margin from model performance
- **Customer Value**: Combined uptime, accuracy, and latency score  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Throughput and error rate performance
- **Risk-Adjusted Return**: ROI calculations with risk factors

### 4. Enhanced Alerting Strategy (`prometheus_rules.yml`)

**Production Model Alerts:**
- `SimpleLSTMAccuracyDrop`: Accuracy <80% for 5 minutes
- `SimpleLSTMLatencySpike`: P95 latency >50ms for 3 minutes
- `SimpleLSTMErrorRateHigh`: Error rate >5% for 2 minutes
- `ModelDriftDetected`: Current accuracy 5% below baseline

**Business KPI Alerts:**
- `LowPredictionThroughput`: <10 predictions/second
- `HighPredictionCost`: >$1.00 per 1000 predictions
- `LowPatternRecognitionRate`: <70% patterns recognized

**Pre-training Workflow Alerts:**
- `PretrainingStalled`: No progress for 30 minutes
- `PretrainingOOM`: Out of memory errors detected
- `PretrainingCheckpointFailed`: Multiple checkpoint failures

### 5. Automated Response Workflows (`automated_response.py`)

**Multi-Tier Response Strategy:**

#### Level 1: Auto-Heal (Low-Medium Severity)
- Memory optimization
- Service restarts
- Cache clearing
- Batch size adjustment

#### Level 2: Alert & Scale (High Severity)

- Full team escalation
- Incident reporting automatically generated
- Post-mortem triggered

**Workflow Configuration:**
