# Phase 8: Mid-Level Architecture Cleanup - Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Branch:** `refactor/architecture-cleanup`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Objective

Conduct mid-level audit and refactor of src/, scripts/, data/, and artifacts/ directories to ensure consistency with refactored architecture and project goals.

---

## 📋 Audit Findings

### Issues Identified
- **15 total issues** across 4 major directories
- **4 high-priority duplicates**
- **4 medium-priority organization issues**
- **7 low-priority cleanup items**

### Key Problems
1. **data/artifacts/** - Complete duplicate of top-level artifacts/
2. **scripts/** - 98 files with no organization (flat structure)
3. **src/moola/utils/** - 24 files in catch-all directory
4. **Schemas scattered** - 3 different locations for schema definitions

---

## ✅ Actions Completed

### **Step 1: Delete Duplicates and Clean Up data/**

**Deleted Directories (6):**
1. ✅ `data/artifacts/` - Merged into top-level `artifacts/`
2. ✅ `data/logs/` - Merged into `artifacts/logs/`
3. ✅ `data/interim/` - Empty, deleted
4. ✅ `data/reports/` - Empty, deleted
5. ✅ `src/moola/diagnostics/` - Empty, deleted
6. ✅ `src/moola/optimization/` - Empty, deleted

**Moved Directories:**
1. ✅ `data/pretraining/` → `data/processed/unlabeled/`
2. ✅ `data/training_cleaned/` → `data/processed/archived/training_cleaned/`
3. ✅ `data/experiments/` → `artifacts/experiments/`

**Merged into artifacts/:**
- `data/artifacts/models/` → `artifacts/models/supervised/`
- `data/artifacts/oof/` → `artifacts/oof/supervised/`
- All splits, predictions, metrics consolidated

---

### **Step 2: Organize scripts/ Directory**

**Before:** 98 scripts in flat structure  
**After:** 7 organized categories

**Created Subdirectories:**
1. ✅ `scripts/data/` - 11 scripts (data extraction, processing)
   - extract_batch_200.py
   - merge_candlesticks_annotations.py
   - fix_train_latest_features.py
   - generate_structure_labels.py
   - etc.

2. ✅ `scripts/training/` - 7 scripts (model training)
   - train_lstm_optimized.py
   - deploy_174_training.sh
   - test_simple_lstm.py
   - etc.

3. ✅ `scripts/pretraining/` - 4 scripts (self-supervised learning)
   - runpod_pretrain_bilstm.py
   - monitor_pretraining.py
   - compare_masked_lstm_results.py
   - etc.

4. ✅ `scripts/runpod/` - 6 scripts (RunPod deployment)
   - build_runpod_bundle.sh
   - deploy_to_fresh_pod.py
   - runpod_baseline_workflow.sh
   - etc.

5. ✅ `scripts/evaluation/` - 10 scripts (model evaluation)
   - generate_full_oof.py
   - select_best_model.py
   - aggregate_results.py
   - etc.

6. ✅ `scripts/cleanlab/` - 4 scripts (CleanLab integration)
   - export_for_cleanlab_studio.py
   - convert_to_cleanlab_format.py
   - etc.

7. ✅ `scripts/utils/` - 24 scripts (utilities, testing)
   - test_*.py scripts
   - validate_*.py scripts
   - verify_*.py scripts
   - etc.

8. ✅ `scripts/internal/` - 6 scripts (from src/moola/scripts/)
   - deploy_fixes.py
   - test_encoder_fixes.py
   - etc.

**Impact:**
- 98 scripts organized into 7 logical categories
- Easy to find specific scripts
- Clear separation of concerns

---

### **Step 3: Reorganize src/moola/utils/**

**Before:** 24 files in flat structure  
**After:** 4 organized categories + core utils

**Created Subdirectories:**
1. ✅ `utils/augmentation/` - 4 files
   - augmentation.py
   - financial_augmentation.py
   - mixup.py
   - temporal_augmentation.py

2. ✅ `utils/training/` - 3 files
   - early_stopping.py
   - training_utils.py
   - training_pipeline_integration.py

3. ✅ `utils/validation/` - 4 files
   - data_validation.py
   - pseudo_sample_validation.py
   - pseudo_sample_examples.py
   - pseudo_sample_generation.py

4. ✅ `utils/metrics/` - 3 files
   - metrics.py
   - losses.py
   - focal_loss.py

**Remaining at Top Level:** 10 core utility files
- seeds.py
- results_logger.py
- windowing.py
- etc.

**Impact:**
- 24 files organized into 4 logical categories
- Clear separation of augmentation, training, validation, metrics
- Core utils remain easily accessible

---

### **Step 4: Consolidate src/moola/**

**Schema Consolidation:**
1. ✅ `src/moola/schema.py` → `src/moola/schemas/legacy_schema.py`
2. ✅ `src/moola/data_infra/schemas.py` → `src/moola/schemas/data_schemas.py`
3. ✅ `src/moola/data_infra/schemas_11d.py` → `src/moola/schemas/schemas_11d.py`

**Result:** All schemas now in `src/moola/schemas/` directory

**Scripts Consolidation:**
1. ✅ `src/moola/scripts/` → `scripts/internal/`
   - Moved 6 internal scripts
   - Deleted empty `src/moola/scripts/` directory

**Kept:**
- `src/moola/experiments/` - Contains benchmark, data_manager, validation (distinct from pipelines)

---

## 📊 Impact Summary

### **Files Reorganized**
- **148 files changed** in git commit
- **98 scripts** organized into 7 categories
- **24 utils** organized into 4 categories
- **3 schema locations** consolidated into 1

### **Directories Deleted**
- 6 duplicate/empty directories removed
- `data/artifacts/`, `data/logs/`, `data/interim/`, `data/reports/`
- `src/moola/diagnostics/`, `src/moola/optimization/`

### **Directories Created**
- 7 script categories
- 4 utils categories
- Consolidated schemas directory

### **Data Consolidation**
- All artifacts now in top-level `artifacts/`
- All data in `data/` with clear taxonomy
- No more duplicates between `data/artifacts/` and `artifacts/`
