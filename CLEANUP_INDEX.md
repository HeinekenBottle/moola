## Key Statistics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Top-level scripts | 40 | 28 | 30% cleaner |
| Artifact directories | 45+ | 9 | 78% consolidated |
| Documentation files | 0 | 3 | Complete reference |
| Files deleted | N/A | 0 | 100% preserved |

## What Was Done

### ✓ Completed
- Archived 12 experimental scripts to scripts/archive/experiments/
- Reorganized artifacts from 45+ to 9 top-level directories
- Created 3 comprehensive documentation files
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility
- Preserved all model files and data

### ✓ NOT Done (Intentionally)
- No Python code changes
- No breaking changes to imports/paths
- No files deleted (only moved/reorganized)
- No data loss
- No refactoring of core logic

## For Future Reference

### When to Use Each Document
- **Debugging/Questions about organization?** → Read artifacts/README.md
- **Want to resurrect an archived script?** → Read scripts/archive/experiments/README.md
- **Need technical details of cleanup?** → Read CLEANUP_SUMMARY_2025-10-27.md
- **Quick overview?** → This file (CLEANUP_INDEX.md)

### When to Update Documentation
- New experiment? → Document in artifacts/README.md
- Archive old scripts? → Update scripts/archive/experiments/README.md
- Change directory structure? → Update both README files
- New core script? → Document in CLAUDE.md

## Core Scripts Reference

**Always use these for training:**
1. `train_baseline_100ep.py` - Baseline reference
2. `train_jade_pretrain.py` - Pre-training
3. `train_stones_only.py` - Stones variant

**Never use these (archived):**
- `train_augmented_20ep.py` - Augmentation experiments
- `finetune_*.py` variants - Various failed attempts
- `experiment_*.py` scripts - Old threshold/comparison runs
- Anything in `scripts/archive/experiments/`
